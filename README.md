## Motivation

How do retailers determine how successful a storefront is? How do they acquire data to quantify this success?

## Product

DisplaySense utilizes an ensemble of off-the-shelf hardware, open vision, facial expression sentiment analysis & deep learning techniques to quantify the effectiveness of a store front.  

Our solution is:
* Easily scalable to multiple stores, displays, aisles & security cameras
* Sensitive to customerâ€™s privacy
* Is easily understandable via a centralized dashboard
* Can ensemble with other data sources

## Data Pipeline

### Video Stream Acquisition

Leverage existing and new hardware at storefronts to record video to be analyzed

### Deep Learning & Open Vision

Extract demographic & sentiment features from video for analysis using AWS Rekognition

### DisplaySense Analytics

Display aggregated impressions & data of storefront in a dashboard

### Components

#### 1. Video Stream

This can be a live stream from a camera or video recorded previously.

#### 2. AWS S3 Bucket

The video is pushed to an S3 bucket in order to easily interact with other AWS services in the next steps.

#### 3. AWS Rekognition

Video is analyzed for information on human faces that have been detected in the video.

#### 4. AWS SNS

Once Rekognition has completed a job SNS notifies and pushes the result to a queue. 

#### 5. AWS SQS

First-in, first-out queue that allows us to retrieve the results of completed jobs.

#### 6. Dashboard

Displays aggregate results from the analyzed video data.
